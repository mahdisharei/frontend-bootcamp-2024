# ‚è±Ô∏è Pomodoro Timer ‚Äì Work/Break + Progress Bar (HTML + JS)

A minimal **Pomodoro** timer: 25 minutes of focused work followed by a short break.  
Includes an ASCII-style progress bar rendered directly in the page.


## ‚ú® Features
- **25:00 work countdown** with minutes/seconds
- **Break phase scaffold** (2 minutes) ready to hook in
- **Text-based progress bar** that fills over time
- Simple, dependency-free HTML + vanilla JS


üß† How It Works
	‚Ä¢	Clicking Start to work calls countDown().
	‚Ä¢	Two setInterval timers decrement seconds (every 1s) and minutes (every 60s).
	‚Ä¢	A third interval advances a loading bar (‚ñà ‚Ä¶ ‚ñë) over a fixed LENGTH.
